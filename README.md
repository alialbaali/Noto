## Motivation

<p>
There are a lot of note-taking apps available out-there, but only a few that do it well. Well, Noto is one of them.

The goal of Noto is to be a minimalistic, free, and open-source note-taking application that meets the user's
expectations, with privacy in mind.

Noto is also part of my [portfolio](https://alialbaali.com) projects. It showcases my skills regarding software development.

## Support

I'm a **solo** developer, and **Noto** was one of my first projects when I started learning Software Development
almost **4 years ago**, and it has come a long way since then. I also have worked on various side projects, but **Noto**
remained to this day **my main focus**.

So, if you'd like to see **Noto** remains maintained with new features, improvements, and bug fixes, I would
really **appreciate** any support coming from my **amazing** community ü§ó
